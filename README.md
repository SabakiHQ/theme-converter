# theme-converter

Converts Sabaki v0.3x themes into v0.4x themes.

## How to use

Download binaries from [Releases](https://github.com/SabakiHQ/theme-converter/releases). Then run:

~~~
$ ./theme-converter-linux ./path/to/css/folder
~~~

theme-converter will get all the CSS files from the given folder path recursively and transform them into working Sabaki v0.40+ themes most of the cases.

It's best to clean the transformed CSS afterwards and test the theme to make sure everything is working as expected.
